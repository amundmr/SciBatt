Reading, filtering and plotting electrochemical data

  

The package is built out of three submodules:

-  **Readers** which transform raw data into a standardized format

-  **Filters** which allows transformations, calculations and changes to the data

-  **Plotters** which allows easy plotting of the data from Readers or Filters.

  

The package is intended to be used to import into your own script
